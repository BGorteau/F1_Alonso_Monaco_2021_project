# F1_Alonso_Monaco_2021_project

In this project we analyse Fernando Alonso's laps during the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix with the use of signal analysis methods and more particulary with **Cubic spline bases**.

The data were collected from the [Formula One Api](http://ergast.com/mrd/)

## Steps of the project
### Clean the data
- Variable selection
- Remove outliers
### Visualization of speed curves
- Visualize speed curves for all laps
### Choosing nodes for the cubic spline base
We choose nodes for two different bases.
- Choose nodes
- Visualization of smoothed curves
### Exploratory statistics
- Study of mean and variance
- Covariance and correlation
- Functional PCA
